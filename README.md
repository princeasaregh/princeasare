- 👋 Hi, I’m Prince Asare
- 👀 I’m a Research Fellow at the Bacteriology Department of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research - University of Ghana (UG) and interested in bacteria genomics
- 🌱 As a young scientist, and a trained molecular epidemiologist, I have developed keen interest in mycobacterial diseases over the past decade with specialties on the field, in the wet lab and now learning to expand my dry lab skills 
- 💞️ My career vision and aspirations are to use the invaluable knowledge and skills gained to lead a research team to explore mycobacterial diseases of public health importance focusing on understanding transmission dynamics and detecting epidemics using genomic epidemiology as well as computational biology approaches to aid their management and control and as such I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who shares in my vision
